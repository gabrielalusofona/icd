    "## 1. General Objective\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to consolidate the fundamental concepts of Data Science by performing an exploratory data analysis and classification models to predict whether an individual's annual income is $>50$K or $\\leq 50$K.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Instructions\n",
    "* The project is individual.\n",
    "* It must be completed within 2 weeks from the publication date.\n",
    "* Your submission must include:\n",
    "    - a notebook (Jupyter, Colab, or equivalent),\n",
    "    - a pdf report (around 6 pages), written clearly and professionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the Adult Census Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:\n",
    "[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 48,842 records and 14 socioeconomic attributes, such as age, educational level, weekly working hours, emploument type, and marital status.\n",
    "The target variable is `income`, with two classes:\n",
    "* `$\\leq 50K$`\n",
    "* `$> 50K$`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "Your EDA should include, at minimum:\n",
    "* Descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical variables.\n",
    "* Handling of missing values.\n",
    "* Distribution analysis of the main features.\n",
    "* Identification of outliers.\n",
    "* Exploration of the target variable, including class imbalance.\n",
    "* Relevant visualisations to support insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "You must interpret all visualisations and statistical outputs.\n",
    "It is not enough to simply generate plots or descriptive statistics — you must analyse them, explain what they reveal about the dataset, and discuss how these insights might influence preprocessing decisions or model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Data Preparation\n",
    "* Encoding of categorical variables.\n",
    "* Normalisation/standardisation (when appropriate).\n",
    "* Train/test split.\n",
    "* A brief justification of your preprocessing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Modelling: Test 3 Different Classifiers\n",
    "You must choose three classification models to explore. For each classifier, you must provide:\n",
    "* A short explanation of how the classifier work.\n",
    "* Justification of chosen hyperparameters.\n",
    "* Comparison of performance on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Evaluation Using Classification Metrics\n",
    "You must evaluate all models using Accuracy and a Confusion Matrix.\n",
    "In addition, you are required to explore other classification metrics. To do this, research relevant classification metrics and explain how they can be used to assess the performance of your classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your analysis should include a discussion of:\n",
    "* The differences between the metrics.\n",
    "* The advantages and disadvantages of each model.\n",
    "* The effect of lass imbalance.\n",
    "* Which models generate more false positives or false negatives and why."
